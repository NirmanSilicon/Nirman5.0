# Trivexa: AI-Powered Health & Medicine Search Engine

Trivexa is an AI-powered search engine designed for the Indian market, focusing on homeopathy, allopathy, and Ayurveda. Our mission is to empower users with a seamless and intuitive platform to find and purchase prescribed medicines and their generic alternatives.

## The Problem We Solve

In a diverse market like India, a significant portion of the population relies on traditional and alternative medicine. However, accessing reliable information and finding the best purchasing options can be challenging, especially for the rural population. Trivexa bridges this gap by providing an intelligent, voice-enabled assistant that guides users in their native languages.

##  Key Features

- **AI-Powered Search**: A sophisticated search engine that understands user queries and provides accurate results for medicines across homeopathy, allopathy, and Ayurveda.
- **Conversational AI Chat**: Chat with our AI assistant to get personalized recommendations, find generic alternatives, and understand the vitals of prescribed medicines.
- **Voice Calling Assistant**: Our unique selling proposition—a voice assistant that guides users in native Indian languages, making it accessible to a broader audience.
- **Personalized & Geo-Accurate Results**: The assistant modifies search results based on user preferences and provides geo-accurate information.
- **Affiliate Links**: Seamlessly redirecting users to e-commerce websites to purchase products, with a revenue-sharing model.

##  Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: `Vite + React` for a fast and interactive user experience, with `GSAP` for animations.
- **Backend**: `Flask` for its robustness, simplicity, and scalability.
- **Database**: `SQLite` for a lightweight and efficient database solution.
- **AI & Machine Learning**:
  - **ASR/TTS**: `Murf AI` for voice support in multiple Indian languages.
  - **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**: To provide advanced knowledge about medicines.
  - **LLMs**: Future plans to fine-tune smaller language models like `Llama3` for more accurate and context-aware results.

##  Revenue Model

Our primary revenue stream is through affiliate marketing. When a user is redirected to a product page via our platform and makes a purchase, we receive a share of the sale. The affiliate share is dependent on the product and the partner company.

##  Future Scope

- **Fine-Tune LLMs**: We plan to fine-tune smaller language models to enhance the accuracy and personalization of our AI assistant.
- **Expand Language Support**: Increase the number of supported Indian languages in our voice assistant.
- **Mobile Application**: Develop a dedicated mobile app for a more integrated user experience.
