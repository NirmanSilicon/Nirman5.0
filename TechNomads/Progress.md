## Final Presentation & Judging
  We are confident in our progress and look forward to presenting our final product. Our primary goal is to deliver a seamless and impactful user experience, which is especially important for our target audience in rural areas who may not be familiar with technology. As such, we have allocated 40% of our design efforts to ensure that our app/service is beginner-friendly and easy to navigate. We believe that this focus on design will be crucial in achieving our overall goal of increasing awareness about Ayurveda, Allopathy, and Homeopathy in rural areas.
